Project created with target to improve me my authentication's knowledge with firebase. For this i built a simple page and adding an authentication with firebase.

To keep a minimal level of security i used a `.env` file and saved my firebase keys in it but you can get yourself your own keys clicking on this link: [Firebase Console - Google](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
